      <h3>Early Life</h3>
      <p>Sarah Breedlove - who later takes the name and creates a business empire called Madam C. J. Walker – is born on December 23, 1867 near Delta, Louisiana. She is born on a cotton plantation where her parents, Owen and Minerva Anderson Breedlove, had been enslaved before the end of the Civil War.
      Breedlove is the youngest of five children and the only one born after the Emancipation Proclamation - therefore, she is born free. 
      In 1873, Breedlove's mother dies and in 1875, her father dies. Breedlove moves to Vicksburg, MS to be with her sister, Louvenia.</p>

    <div class="motherhood">
      <h3>Marriage, Motherhood and Early Origins of Business</h3>
      <p>In 1881, at age 14, Breedlove marries Moses McWilliams to escape abuse from her brother-in-law. 
      Her only daughter, Lelia (later known as A’Lelia Walker) is born on June 6, 1885. Breedlove is 17.
      At 20, in 1887, Breedlove's husband Moses dies. Breedlove moves to St. Louis to join her four brothers, Alexander, James, Solomon, and Owen Jr., who are working as barbers.
      <br><br>In 1894, Breedlove marries John Davis. In her 20s, she suffers from a scalp ailment that causes her to lose most of her hair. She consults with her brothers for advice and experiments with home-made and store brought products.
      She starts using hair products from Annie Malone, and becomes a sales agent for Malone's Poro Co.</p>

      <h3>Becomes Madam <span>C.J.</span> Walker</h3>
      <p>In 1905 Breedlove's brothers die, and she separates from 2nd husband John Davis.
      In July of that same year, at age 38, she moves to Denver, CO as a sales agent for Malone.
      She marries her 3rd husband, Charles Joseph Walker, and changes her name to Madam C.J. Walker.
      She begins selling Madam Walker's Wonderul Hair Grower, a scalp conditioning and healing formula, which she says came to her in a dream.
      Madam Walker’s five original products were Madam Walker’s Wonderful Hair Grower, Temple Salve, Tetter Salve, Vegetable Shampoo and Glossine.
      <br><br>Starting in September 1906, Breedloves travels for a year and a half through the South and Southeast, selling her products door to door, doing demonstrations in churches and lodges, and devising her sales and marketing strategies.
      In 1908 at age 41, she moves to Pittsburgh, PA where she opens Lelia College, to train Walker "hair culturists."
      In 1912 she divorces Charles Joseph Walker.</p>

      <h3>Later Life</h3>
      <p>In 1910 at age 43, Breedlove settles in Indianapolis, Indiana, where she builds a factory, a hair and manicure salon and another training school.
      Less than a year later, she makes headlines in the black press for $1,000 contribution to the building fund of the "colored" Indianapolis Senate Avenue YMCA.
      In 1913, she travels to Central America and Caribbean to expand her business.
      In that same year, her daughter A'Lelia moves into a Harlem townhouse and the Walker Salon, designed by <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertner_Woodson_Tandy" target=_blank>the black architect Vertner Tandy.</a></p>
      </div>

    <div class="naacp"> 
      <p>In 1916, at 49, Breedlove moves to New York city, leaving daily operations of the Madam C.J. Walker Manufacturing Company in Indianapolis to FB Ransom, her lawyer, and Alice Kelly, her factory forelady and a former school teacher.
      Breedloves continues to oversee the business and works in the NYC office.
      She becomes involved in Harlem's political and social life, including making a $5,000 contribution (equivalent today $72,700) to the NAACP's anti-lynching movement.
      At the time, this is the largest individual gift the NAACP has ever recieved.</p>
